# A-Kademy

This is a **personal project**, developed from **zero** to **practice my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript**. The idea is to create a website for a gym, with totally original **design and functionalities**, without external references.

### Technologies used

- CSS3** - Styling, with emphasis on Flexbox, responsive layouts and design from scratch
- JavaScript - Basic functionalities for simple interactions

### Objectives

- To practice creating layouts without resorting to frameworks or external libraries
- Learn and apply modern CSS techniques (such as Flexbox and Grid)
- Create a fully responsive page, adapted for mobile devices

- Implement basic interactions with **JavaScript** to improve the user experience

### Status

- Project in progress - Currently focused on HTML structuring and CSS styling, with simple JS interactions.
- I plan to develop the page into a functional website in the future.
